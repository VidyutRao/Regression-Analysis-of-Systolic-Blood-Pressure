# Regression-Analysis-of-Systolic-Blood-Pressure
In this problem, we perform data analysis on a dataset containing the blood pressure data of 199 individuals. We begin with some explanatory data analysis, succeeded by building regression models based on stepwise selection and all subsets selection. The objective is to predict Systolic Blood Pressure from the 8 given explanatory variables. We use Python for exploratory data analysis and feature engineering and move on to R for variable selection.
